# About the Project

This project's main goal is to reinforce the concepts taught in the course through hands-on practice. By keeping all my work in one place, I can easily review code, track my learning journey, and build a portfolio of Python skills.

The content is organized by topic or module, with each folder containing the relevant exercises and solutions.

## What's Inside?

This repository covers a range of foundational and intermediate Python topics, including:

- [x] Core Concepts: Variables, data types, and basic operations.

- [x] Control Flow: Conditionals (if/else), loops (for and while).

- [x] Data Structures: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

- [x] Functions & Modules: Creating and using functions, and importing external libraries.

- [ ] Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, and inheritance.
